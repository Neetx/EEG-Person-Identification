# EEG Person Identification

This is the project I prepared for the Biometric Systems exam, it's an implementation of a paper called "EEG-based user identification system using 1D-convolutional long short-term memory neural networks".

THIS IS NOT MY RESEARCH, I programmed everything starting from their repository: https://github.com/ys4315/EEG-user-identification
It has matlab and python (tensorflow 1.1) components, so I ported all the code to an updated python version and using tensorflow 2.6.

For now only the Convolutional Neural Network is implemented, but the paper proposal is a CLDNN (CNN + LSTM layers) and in the future I'll try to implement it too.

The project is a notebook for Google Colab and a python script for local execution.


## Dataset 

The dataset used is the same used by the paper: Physionet EEG motor Movement/Imagery dataset (https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/)
You have to upload this dataset to your google drive in a folder: "/content/gdrive/MyDrive/eeg_person_identification/eeg-motor-movementimagery-dataset-1.0.0/files/" to execute the notebook on Google Colab, otherwise you have to download the dataset on your local machine, create an output folder and write your paths in the code (for now)


## Results

The results are the same reported (97% accuracy)
